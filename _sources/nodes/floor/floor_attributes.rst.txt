Floor Attributes Node
=====================

This node outputs floor attributes as fields. Read more about :ref:`fields`
and :ref:`floors`.

Outputs
-------

Width
  The width of the floor. The value can be grater than final width of the
  floor in case if the floor does not have Fill panel.

Index
  Index of the current floor. Indexing is starting from 0 value. Don't mix
  this with floor number. 0 index does not necessarily coincide with ground
  floor. This is true only if facade is starting from the ground.
