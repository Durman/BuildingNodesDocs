Building properties
-------------------

Error massage
  It is shown if there was an :ref:`error <errors>` during building style
  execution.

Show in edit mode
  In edit mode base mesh and building panels will be displayed simultaneously.
  Editing base mesh will force to update building style. Read about 
  :ref:`limitations` of this mode.

Realtime
  If enabled any changes in a tree of a building style will cause rebuild the
  building model.

Show in render
  Show building style during render.

Apply style (to active)
  Operator which bakes building style into the base mesh.

Apply style (to selected)
  Operator which bakes building style of selected objects.

Apply current style (to all)
  Operator which bakes building styles of all visible objects in case if the
  style is the same with the style of active object.

Link style to selected
  It works similar to other linking functionality of Blender. The operator
  assign building style of active object to selected objects. Also it can remove
  building style in case if active objects does not have any style. It also is
  available via *Link/Transfer data menu* ``Ctrl + l``.

Select with the same style
  The operator selects all visible objects which have the same building style
  as active object.

Building style tree
  Node tree which should be used to generate building


Panel properties
----------------

.. _set_scope_operator:

Set scope
  This is an operator which serves two purposes. It sets origin of the active
  object and its bounding box which is used by Building style editor during
  distribution of panels. In order to use it a :ref:`panel <panels>` should be
  in edit mode and at list two points, corners of bounding box, should be
  selected. Don't use the operator in edit mode of multiple objects.


Node tree interface
===================

.. figure:: /images/ui/Node_settings.*

In case if you are nof familiar with Blender tree interface here is official
`documentation`_ about them.

.. _documentation: https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/controls/nodes/index.html

Unlike Blender build-in nodes in the add-on nearly all nodes have settings.
To open the settings press on the gear picture located in first output socket
of a node. Settings are divided on two parts:

Node properties
  Properties of a node are presented as sockets of some elementary data
  structure as number, string, enum etc. By default most of them are hidden.
  It's possible to change them without showing them in tree UI or it's possible
  to show them py switching show property.

  Properties are associated with logic of node where they are defined or
  with data structure which is produced by this node. For example parameter
  height of a :doc:`/nodes/floor/floor_pattern` is associated with floor which
  is generated by the node. Also properties can be used by another upstream
  nodes.

  Also this properties can be found in ``property panel -> node -> properties``. 

Node remote properties
  The difference between
  normal node properties is that the remote properties are not define in a
  node where they are shown but in some downstream node. It shows which
  remote properties are used by the node.
