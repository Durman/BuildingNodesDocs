====================
Panel Randomize Node
====================

The node expects collection of panels and returns random one from them.

Inputs
------

Panel
  Repeated socket of panels for random choice

Properties
----------

Seed
  Initial value to generated sequence of random values. Several nodes with
  the same seed and collection of panels generate the same sequence of panels.

  .. tip::

     Node generates random sequence only for first floor. If all floors should
     have random panels you can connect Index output of 
     :doc:`/nodes/floor/floor_attributes` to the Seed input.

Remote properties
-----------------

Probability
  The chance of using the panel. For example **A** panel has **1** probability
  and **B** panel has **2** probability. The chance of **A** panel is ``1/3``
  and the chance of **B** panel is ``2/3``.

Outputs
-------

Panel
  Random panel
