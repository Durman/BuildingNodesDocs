If you have a look at the facade you can find that it can be split into a few
principle blocks from which the whole facade can be recreated. This feature of
human dwelling can be used for simplifying modelling of buildings. It's possible
to create a few principle blocks, panels, use some rules to distribute them
along some surfaces, facades, and combine facades into a building. To define
surfaces and building base geometry is used. The advantage of this approach is
that the same panels and rules can be applied to multiple objects. Also it
possible to re-apply the rules whenever an object is changed.

Base geometry
-------------

This is basic Blender mesh object which should be turned into a building.
Before applying rules its geometry is parsed into a facades.
Face is recognized as part of a facade according to certain rules:

- It should be vertical
- It should be a quad
- Faces of one facade should be connected to each other
- Faces of one facade should be oriented in the same direction
- Faces with different materials go to separate facades

.. warning::

   .. figure:: /images/Non_quad.*

      :figwidth: 150px

   By quad means face with 4 vertices. Though the face on the picture has
   shape of a quad it is not recognized as a quad because it has extra 5 vertex.
   Non the less the face won't be ignored but also it won't be part of any
   facade and will represent the entire facade by itself. In future this
   limitation will may gone.

Also it's possible to split faces into different facade by separating them with
line of edges with ``crease`` value equal to 1.

All faces which was not recognized as facade faces are ignored and stay as they
are.

.. _facades:

Facade
------

Facade is 1D array of floors which go from bottom to top. Floors are also 1D
arrays of panels so about the entire facade data structure you can think as
a 2D array or a table. But unlike table each row can have different number of
cells and cells are not necessary joined into columns. Use 
:doc:`/nodes/facade/facade_pattern` to create a facade.

Though the shape of 2D array can't be anything but rectangle a facade can have
any shape which can be build with mesh of quads.

Facade can have any size. Number of floors and number of panels is automatically
adjusted to available space herewith size of panels can be a bit scaled.

Also there is snapping feature. Floors borders and borders between panels can
snap to closest vertical and horizontal edges. If distance between parallel
edges is to close to put there a floor or a panel then such edges are just
ignored.

.. _floors:

Floor
-----

Floor is just horizontal line of panels. The panels are ordered from left to
right. Floor has some height. By default it
is equal to highest panel in a row. If facade has panels with different height
their height is scaled to height of the floor. Floor can be created with
:doc:`/nodes/floor/floor_pattern`.

.. _panels:

Panel
-----

Panels are elementary building blocks of a facade. It typically is a 2D shape
which represents one part of a wall or another. Though it's a 2D shape it can
have protruding parts. Panels are used to be distributed along a facade surface. 
Panel can be created with :doc:`/nodes/panel/panel`.

.. Important::

   .. image:: /images/Panel_orientation.*
      :align: right

   You should be careful about orientation of the panels. They should lay on
   horizontal surface (XY) where X axis is parallel to facade length, Y axis
   is parallel to facade height and Z axis is perpendicular to facade.
   Also it's important to know that origin is also took into account during
   panels instancing. Typically it should be in the center of a panel.

If `XY` orientation of the panels is not convenient you can always rotate and
move panels in object mode however you like.

By default the size of a panel is determined by its bounding box, but it's
possible override the size with :ref:`Set scope operator <set_scope_operator>`. 
It is useful in case if panels should have some overlapping parts. Also
with the operator it's convenient to put origin into center of the panel.

.. _fields:

Fields
------

First of all fields are some elementary data like number, string etc. They
represent some characteristic of facade element as its size or index of its
position.
Fields share the same concept as Geometry Nodes. Read official documentation_.

.. _documentation: https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/fields.html

For example on the picture below Index socket of Floor attributes node outputs
a field. It means that whenever Select Floor node try to read floor index it
actually evaluate a function and thus Index attribute is not some context value
but value which depends on the context.

.. image:: /images/Fields_example.*

Actually every node in the add-on is a field. You can create some floor and use
it in different facades without need of copying it.

.. note::
   As in Geometry nodes project different shapes of sockets are used but their
   meaning is different. In Building nodes also there are sockets with two types
   of shape. Diamond shape is used for sockets which transfer primitive data
   type like numbers, strings, booleans. Circle shape is used for more complex
   data like panels, floors etc.
