Assign Plane to the Panel node and add extra geometry to it. Now you already
can see that the panel was applied to side faces of the cube.

   The orientation of the panel and location of its origin is important. 
   :ref:`Details <panels>`.

Select cube, go to edit mode and move faces perpendicular to the axis. You

Also you can edit topology of the box but make sure that it meets certain 
:ref:`requirements <base_geometry>`.
