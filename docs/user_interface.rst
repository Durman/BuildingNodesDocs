Node tree interface
===================

In case if you are nof familiar with Blender tree interface here is official
`documentation`_ about them.

.. _documentation: https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/controls/nodes/index.html

Node inputs / outputs
  Sockets which expect complex data structure as Panels, Floors etc.

Node properties
  A property of a node can be a socket or enum. Sockets have some simple value
  like float, integer, boolean etc. Properties can be found in node settings
  panel (located directly on a node) or in ``property panel -> node -> properties``
  . Properties are associated with logic of node where they are defined or
  with data structure which is produced by this node. For example parameter
  size of :doc:`/nodes/facade/facade_pattern` is associated with facade which
  is generated by the node.

Node remote properties
  This properties can be found only in node settings. The difference between
  normal node properties is that the remote properties are not define in a
  node where they are shown but in some downstream node. It shows which
  remote properties are used by the node.
